### Cloud-based vs. Local

Web developers usually create and test their code on their own machines, then push their changes to a hosting service.

We can do that, or we can just work directly in a cloud-based online host.

Advantages:

- environment is already set up
- easy to share code
- easy to run a web application

Disadvantages:

- sometimes slower
- fewer choices of editor/IDE

### Starting on the Cloud

Let's create a cloud-based account to start with. We'll be using [PythonAnywhere](http://pythonanywhere.com)

Click on *Pricing & signup*, then *Create a beginner account*.

Choose a name you don't mind sharing. Your web app will appear at accountname.pythonanywhere.com

### Optional: Installing a local development environment

- Get [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for all the extras and scientific computing. Choose Python 3.x
- Get [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com) for a programmer's editor
- Get [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) for an Integrated Development Environment with debugger
