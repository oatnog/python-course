## Getting Handy With Coding: Python

Practical programming using Python.

![Python Logo](/python-course/morea/python-logo.png)

Solve real problems using real programming.

We'll introduce you to [Python](https://python.org), 
then start using it to create web applications and to work with data.

## Why Python?

Python is a very popular language, both in business and in education. It's powerful enough to run scientific analysis and major websites, but straightforward enough to use for small projects.

It's your *Programming Utility Belt* for whatever you're trying to accomplish. 

One of Python's main goals is *readability*. Your programs will be clear and understandable,
even coming back to them after a long break.

When you develop in Python, you move *rapidly.* It's easy to explore the many tools that come with the language and find what you need to get things done. When you can *iterate* rapidly through different techniques and ideas, you won't get bogged down in implementation details.

With the right web framework, Python makes creating tools for the web easy.

And Python is fun!

## We'll learn how to...

- Store user information, postings, and images (see [this example](http://rubel.pythonanywhere.com) )
- Access online information such as weather or beach conditions and use it in your own site
- "Glue" together data from whatever sources you need to, from spreadsheets to MS Access
