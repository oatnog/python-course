#### Online Data
Include a FORM in our web template which POSTs to our micro blog.

Store each posting in our database. Remember, you can use (dataset)[https://dataset.readthedocs.org/] to simplify this process!

Display all postings in order.

#### Possible approaches:

Refer to the example source on Github. https://github.com/oatnog/flaskr


Extension
