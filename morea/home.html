<p>Solve real problems using real programming.</p>

<p>We’ll introduce you to Python, then start using it to create web applications and to work with data.</p>

<h2 id="why-python">Why Python?</h2>

<p>Python is a very popular language, both in business and in education. It’s powerful enough to run scientific analysis and major websites, but straightforward enough to use for small projects.</p>

<p>It’s your Programming Utility Belt for whatever you’re trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>One of Python’s main goals is <em>readability</em>. Your programs will be clear and understandable,
even coming back to them after a long break.</p>

<p>When you develop in Python, you move <em>rapidly.</em> It’s easy to explore the many tools that come with the language and find what you need to get things done. When you can <em>iterate</em> rapidly through different techniques and ideas, you won’t get bogged down in implementation.</p>

<p>With the right web framework, Python makes creating tools for the web easy.</p>

<p>And Python is fun!</p>

<p>We’ll learn how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Store user information, postings, and images (see <a href="http://rubel.pythonanywhere.com">this example</a> )</li>
  <li>Access online information such as weather or beach conditions and use it in your own site</li>
  <li>“Glue” together data from whatever sources you need to, from spreadsheets to MS Access</li>
</ul>
